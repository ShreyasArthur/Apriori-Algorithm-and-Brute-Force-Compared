Apriori Algorithm and Brute force method Compared

To Implement the brute force method and compare the brute force method with the Apriori algorithm on each of the 5 transaction databases created. And also Present the computation (CPU or clock) time to demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm is faster than the brute force method on each of the 5 transaction databases.
